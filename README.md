    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
anyByRight = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-any-by-right@v0.2.3-umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var anyByRight = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/array-base-any-by-right/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-any-by-right@v0.2.3-umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.anyByRight;
})();
</script>
```

#### anyByRight( x, predicate\[, thisArg] )

Tests whether at least one element in an array passes a test implemented by a `predicate` function, while iterating from right to left.

```javascript
function isPositive( value ) {
    return ( value > 0 );
}

var x = [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ];

var bool = anyByRight( x, isPositive );
// returns true
```

If a `predicate` function returns a truthy value, the function **immediately** returns `false`.

```javascript
function isPositive( value ) {
    return ( value > 0 );
}

var x = [ -1, -2, -3, -4 ];

var bool = anyByRight( x, isPositive );
// returns false
```

The `predicate` function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: current array element.
-   **index**: current array element index.
-   **arr**: input array.

To set the `predicate` function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function predicate( value ) {
    this.count += 1;
    return ( value > 0 );
}

var x = [ -1, -2, 3, -4 ];

var context = {
    'count': 0
};

var bool = anyByRight( x, predicate, context );
// returns true

var cnt = context.count;
// returns 2
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The function performs a linear scan and returns immediately upon encountering a truthy return value. Unlike [`Array.prototype.some`][mdn-array-some], when performing a linear scan, the function does **not** skip `undefined` elements.
-   If provided an empty array, the function returns `false`.
